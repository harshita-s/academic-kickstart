 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method to build a textdependent, closed-set, Automatic Speaker Recognition System based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Vector Quantisation, and the combination of Discrete Hidden Markov Models and Minimum Euclidean Distance measure. We comparatively analyze the performance of the hybrid technique against the individual methods, to increase the recognition rate in non-ideal conditions like paused and noisy utterances.},
