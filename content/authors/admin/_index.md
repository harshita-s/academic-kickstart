Dr Harshita Sharma is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Engineering Science](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), and a member of the [Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) group](http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/research/biomedia), advised by [Prof. Alison Noble](http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/research/biomedia/people/professor-alison-noble). She is working on the interdisciplinary [ERC Project PULSE](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/pulse/) (Perception Ultrasound by Learning Sonographic Experience). The aim of the project is to develop methods to model sonographic experience in order to make ultrasound an easier technology for non-specialists. Harshita's current research focuses on image, video and sensory data analysis in medical ultrasound using machine learning, NLP, big data science, and information fusion methods. Her research interests include artificial intelligence and machine learning, big data science, image and signal analysis applied to medicine and healthcare.  

In 2017, Harshita completed her Ph.D. degree (Dr.-Ing.) in computer vision from [TU Berlin] (https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/) after being awarded a full-time DAAD Ph.D. Scholarship, and supervised by Prof. Olaf Hellwich. She collaborated with Charite and KIel. She analysed histopathological whole slide images of gastric carcinoma for computational pathology applications such as automatic cancer grade classification, necrosis detection and cell nuclei classification. 

In 2012-13, Harshita was a lecturer in electronics and communication engineering at the [Jaypee Institute of Information Technology]. In 2012, Harshita obtained her Masters degree (M.Tech.) in electrical engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), and in 2010, a Bachelors degree (B.Tech.) in electronics and communication engineering from the [Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University of Women](https://www.igdtuw.ac.in/). In 2011-12, she was an exchange research scholar at Technical University Berlin under the DAAD-IIT Master Sandwich Programme. Here, she explored histopathological breast cancer biopsies for content-based image retrival. She was part of the VSS project..
