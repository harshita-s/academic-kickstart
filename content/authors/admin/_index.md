Dr. Harshita Sharma is a PostDoc in the [Department of Engineering Science](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), and a member of the [Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) group](http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/research/biomedia), advised by [Prof. Alison Noble](http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/research/biomedia/people/professor-alison-noble). She is working in the interdisciplinary [ERC Project PULSE](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/pulse/) (Perception Ultrasound by Learning Sonographic Experience) with the aim to develop multi-modal analysis methods to model sonographic experience to make obstetric ultrasound imaging easier for non-specialists. Harshita's research interests include artificial intelligence and machine learning, NLP, big data science, image and signal analysis applied to medicine and healthcare.  

In 2017, Harshita obtained her Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) in Computer Vision from [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/) advised by [Prof. Olaf Hellwich](https://www.cv.tu-berlin.de/menue/mitarbeiter/olaf_hellwich/), after being awarded a full-time DAAD Ph.D. Scholarship (2013-17). She was a member of the [Computer Vision and Remote Sensing group (CVRS)](https://www.cv.tu-berlin.de/menue/computer_vision_remote_sensing/) at TU Berlin. She collaborated with [Charité University Hospital](https://www.charite.de/en/), [VMScope GmbH Berlin](http://vmscope.com/index.php?id=4), and [University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein](https://www.uksh.de/). She analysed histopathological whole slide images of gastric carcinoma to develop methods in computational pathology for automatic cancer grade classification, necrosis detection and cell nuclei classification.

In 2012-13, Harshita was a lecturer in electronics and communication engineering at the [Jaypee Institute of Information Technology](http://www.jiit.ac.in/). In 2011-12, she was fortunate to be an exchange research scholar at Technical University Berlin under the DAAD-IIT Master Sandwich Programme, where she explored histopathological breast cancer biopsies for content-based image retrieval and collaborated in the [Virtual Specimen Scout](http://www.specimen-scout.de/) project of Charité University Hospital Berlin, TU Berlin, VMscope GmbH Berlin and NEXUS AG Villingen-Schwenningen. In 2012, Harshita obtained her Masters degree (M.Tech.) in electrical engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), and in 2010, and Bachelors degree (B.Tech.) in electronics and communication engineering from the [Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University of Women](https://www.igdtuw.ac.in/).
